# Getting Started with Python

### History Behind Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose, modern programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s (and named after the famous comedic troupe: Monty Python).

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.

Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. 

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 

Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

### Python Basics

Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation.

Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.

**Why Python?**

- Python is easy to use.
- Python is expressive.
- Python is readable.
- Python is complete - "batteries included".
- Python is cross-platform.
- Python is free.

**What Python is not**

- Python isn't the fastest language.
- Python doesn't have the most libraries.
- Python doesn't check variable types at compile time.
- Python doesn't have much mobile support.
- Python doesn't use multiple processing well.
